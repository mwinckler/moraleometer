# Morale-O-Meter

_(This project is a work-in-progress; it does not currently have any useful features.)_

The Morale-O-Meter is an application for keeping track of daily personal metrics such as how much sleep you got, how much caffeine you consumed, what your overall mood is, etc. It can also be used to generate reports on how faithfully you've been completing self-imposed tasks (like a habit tracker).

This project is in the early stages of development. There is a [Trello board tracking current work](https://trello.com/b/QcWxTwR4/moraleometer).
